Defining the project itself is part of the work, but here are some guidelines. In addition to demoing these for your group, you should get the instructor's thumbs up to be sure you earned the xp (I may ask for revisions/additions before signing off on it). You may also negotiate with the instructor for other ideas you have.\n",
    "    * **Small project prototype:** 5xp. Create a prototype for a software application which uses ideas from the course (no set standard for \"size\", but I'm thinking about 100 lines of original personally-written code or 5-10 hours of work)\n",

    "    * **Extended implementation:** 5xp. Take the ideas from workshop presentation, *use additional resources*, and take it farther - implement new variations of an algorithm, use additional options/parameters, try things with different libraries, etc.\n",
    "    * **Present project to the class:** 1xp. After your group demo, groups may nominate someone to present tot he entire class. If you do so, you get an extra point of xp.\n",
    "    * **Write a tutorial:** 5xp. Write up a tutorial with original writing (citing any sources) explaining concepts or showing how to use tools/modules/libraries related to the course. Here are some examples of articles in this genre (but for non-NLP topics) - you can find many more on sites like these:\n",

    "    * **Run a workshop:** 10xp - *subject to instructor approval and must be arranged in advance*. Pick a new topic that we haven't scheduled or haven't covered yet, and run a workshop for that day. It should include a mini-presentation and some work for students to do. \n",
    "    * **Team work:** 2xp. Earn these *additional* points on one of the above creative synthesis items that you worked on in collaboration with one or more other students. All team members should do enough individual work to meet the requirements on their own, and you must document individual work in your portfolio, but you will be rewarded for coordinating it in a teamwork setting.\n",
    "    * **Topic integration:** 2xp. Earn these *additional* points on one of the above creative synthesis items that includes substantial combination of two or more different course topics (or a course topic and another topic outside the scope of the class - an NLP topic we didn't cover, something from another course, etc.), integrated into one cohesive deliverable."
