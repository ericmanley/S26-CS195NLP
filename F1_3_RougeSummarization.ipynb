    "The water conditions in Iowa continued to be a buzzing topic less than a week after Drake hosted the Water Quality Solutions Town Hall on Nov. 15, a follow-up to a Central Iowa Source Water Resource Assessment report. \n",
    "\n",
    "The water quality tracking data in the report showed that potentially harmful nitrates were found in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Shriver, director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute, was one of five panelists who discussed the connection between public health and the state of Iowa’s nature due to human impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "During his time on the podium, Shriver focused on the potential connection between water quality and the growing cancer rates, especially amongst younger age groups in Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Iowa having the number two cancer rate in the country is something that I think should be troubling to all of us, both because of how devastating cancer is and also because many young people are choosing to leave the state partly because of concerns about this topic,” Shriver said. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the population decline amongst young people is concerning, Shriver noted a growing concern from Iowan citizens, recalling the Central Iowa Source Water Resource Assessment event hosted by the Harkin Institute that gathered over 600 in-person attendees and thousands online.  \n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve got grandchildren [in Iowa] thinking about the future and them seeing the decline of quality in the state, how much it can be hurt,” said Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement member Tim Goldman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shriver said that it’s important to be knowledgeable and raise awareness about the issue of water quality. By supporting change-making organizations such as the Harkin Institute, Iowa Environmental Council and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvements, Iowans can aid in affecting state policies and laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Ultimately, the reason we have high nitrates in our waters and why Iowa applies 53 million pounds of pesticides every year have to do with the policies that are in place … I’m a believer that the way change happens is through organized money or through organized people,” Shriver said. “People advocating for change are often at a disadvantage when it comes to money, so we need to go all out for organizing people.” \n",
    "\n",
    "With the upcoming 2026 elections, Shriver said that keeping environmental issues affecting Iowan communities in mind when voting is one of the ways for change and bettering of Iowan health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shriver furthermore expressed the importance of the growing cancer rates to be a topic of discussion among Iowa leaders, and the importance of opening conversations regarding agricultural practices that may be the root of the issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like Shriver, John Norris, a former Polk County administrator who commissioned the CISWRA report, marked the importance of Iowan values in guiding future policies. Norris advised attendees of the Water Quality Solutions Town Hall to vote in upcoming elections with valuing clean water in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have to start anchoring our politics in values,” Norris said. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through continued research regarding the correlation between water quality and cancer, the Harkin Institute will continue holding events in collaboration with various organizations to keep not only the community but the state of Iowa informed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation “Cancer in Polk County” will be hosted at Sheslow Auditorium along with a virtual Zoom option on Tuesday, Jan. 13, from 5-7 p.m. In the days following, the “Environmental Risk Factors and Cancer” report will be released in conjunction with the Iowa Environmental Council to continue the conversation.\n",

These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.\\n(2) These veterans’ organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.\\n(b) As a result of congressional chartering of these veterans’ organizations, the United States Internal Revenue Service created a special tax exemption for these organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n(c) Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that, among other attributes, carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, conducts programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, sponsors or participates in activities of a patriotic nature, and provides social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(d) Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that all buildings, support and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which ensures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, are exempt from taxation.\\n(e) The Chief Counsel of the State Board of Equalization concluded, based on a 1979 appellate court decision, that only parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation and that other parts, such as billiard rooms, card rooms, and similar areas, are not exempt.\\n(f) In a 1994 memorandum, the State Board of Equalization’s legal division further concluded that the areas normally considered eligible for exemptions are the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans’ records, but that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charitable purposes.\\n(g) Tax-exempt status is intended to provide economic incentive and support to veterans’ organizations to provide for the social welfare of the community of current and former military personnel.\\n(h) The State Board of Equalization’s constriction of the tax exemption has resulted in an onerous tax burden on California veteran service organizations posts or halls, hinders the posts’ ability to provide facilities for veterans, and threatens the economic viability of many local organizations.\\n(i) The charitable activities of a veteran service organizations post or hall are much more than the counseling of veterans. The requirements listed for qualification for the federal tax exemption clearly dictate a need for more than just an office.\\n(j) Programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions.\\n(k) Programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes require space for more than 50 attendees.\\n(l) Activities of a patriotic nature need facilities to accommodate hundreds of people.\\n(m) Social and recreational activities for members require precisely those areas considered “not used for charitable purposes” by the State Board of Equalization.\\n(n) The State Board of Equalization’s interpretation of the Revenue and Taxation Code reflects a lack of understanding of the purpose and programs of the veterans service organizations posts or halls and is detrimental to the good works performed in support of our veteran community.\\nSECTION 1.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\\n215.1.\\n(a) All buildings, and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, and exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, shall be exempt from taxation.\\n(b) The exemption provided for in this section shall apply to the property of all organizations meeting the requirements of this section, subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, and paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 214.\\n(c) (1) The exemption specified by subdivision (a) shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes.\\n(2) With regard to this subdivision, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(A) The exempt activities of a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans’ organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization’s exempt purposes and activities.\\n(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.\\n(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. The portion of the property ineligible for the veterans’ organization exemption shall be that area used primarily to prepare and serve alcoholic beverages.\\n(e) An organization that files a claim for the exemption provided for in this section shall file with the assessor a valid organizational clearance certificate issued pursuant to Section 254.6.\\n(f) This exemption shall be known as the “veterans’ organization exemption.”\\nSEC. 2.\\nSEC. 3.\\nNotwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act.\\nSEC. 3.\\nSEC. 4.\\nThis act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.',\n",
